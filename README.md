# Spectrobes Brawl
A miniature Spectrobes fangame built in about 3 months. The goal was simply to create the only playable Spectrobes browser game in existence right now. The result was an infinite Krawl-brawler where the player battles waves of Krawl in DS-style realtime action using Spikan, Komanoto, and Samurite.
This project will not be developed any further.
